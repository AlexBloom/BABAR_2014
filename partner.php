				<p>Bike & Build allows young adults to invest in communities across the United States through service-based cycling trips.</p> 	
				
				<p>Each summer our cyclists pedal across the United States, raising money for the affordable housing cause and building homes for low-income families. This experience also fosters a commitment to civic engagement far beyond their Bike & Build summer.</p>

				<h2>Why We Ride</h2>
			
				<p>Why is Bike & Build such an impactful experience on our riders? It starts with the <a href="http://www.bikeandbuild.org/cms/content/view/9242/492/"target=_blank>severity of this country’s affordable housing crisis</a>. The takeaway: nearly 50 million Americans do not have the means to own an affordable, durable home. That’s more than the populations of Texas and Florida, combined. </p>

				<h2>How Can You Help?</h2>
				 
				<p>Become a sustaining partner with Bike & Build. We will work with you to customize a partnership package that accomplishes your organization’s needs, while empowering both of our organizations to have an impact on affordable housing in your community. </p>

				<p>Our message reaches all corners of the United States.</p>
