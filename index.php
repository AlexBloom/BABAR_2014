				<h1>Horizons</h1>

				<p>When Bike & Build riders dip their back tires in the Atlantic Ocean, they face a line that divides earth and sky.  The horizon is a picturesque visualization of possibility, as riders stand on the cusp of an unforgettable summer. What lies ahead, in the open road, is an adventure that will test their limits. Ultimately, when our riders crest the horizon that holds the Pacific in view, one summer and 4,000 miles later, they’ve broadened their own vantage points, many ready to serve their communities long after Bike & Build. </p>

				<p>Our trips challenge riders to find the relationship between visible and theoretical horizons.  The subject matter crosses nearly every realm - physical, integral, impact, and identity. “Can I ride 117 miles in a day?”, “Who knew I could learn so much from a Grandmother in Nebraska?”, “How and to whom can we best allocate the money we fundraised?”, “What is my influence now and what could it be?”, “What is next?”.</p>
 
				<p>The answers to those questions compose Bike & Build’s enduring impact.</p>   
 
				<p>The Bike & Build Board of Directors and staff are tremendously proud of the nearly 330 young adults who participated in Bike & Build in 2014. We aim to continue broadening their impact, as we are inspired by these young adults who are committed to a lifetime of service, the housing organizations and low-income families that we support, and the host communities that advocate with us. Each person and family touched by Bike & Build sees views their own horizon differently, but we share one a common goal: more affordable homes for our fellow citizens, and more opportunities for young adults to continue serving to make it so.</p> 
 
				<p>There are a wealth of vantage points in the thousands of miles between Atlantic and Pacific. We are excited to share with you just a few in our 2014 Annual Report.</p>

				<h2>Coastal Drift</h2>
			
				<p>This year, Bike & Build unveiled Coastal Drift, a new regional route from Maine’s Acadia National Park to New York City. Over the course of 3 weeks and 830 miles, riders weaved in and out of island towns and major metropolises, traversing both urban and rural landscapes and experiencing the mutable affordable housing issue that parallels the varied terrain. Riders experienced the best of Bike & Build in a compact time frame: scenic roads, multiple build days, and the ability to observe and create change in the world around them. The trip was shorter, but the soul was the same- spurred by young adults with adventurous spirits and involved citizens with tremendous hearts.</p>

				<h2>The Bike & Build Alumni Council</h2>
			
				<p>The Alumni Council represents the nearly 2,300-member constituency of former B&Bers who remain committed to service in communities around the United States.</p> 

				<p>Some former riders spoke about the impact Bike & Build had on them, and how they are staying involved in their community. </p>

				<p>The 2014 Council, led by Kyle Magida (SUS06, B2SB08) and David Neirenberg (SUS05), led numerous projects in support of Bike & Build’s mission. Alums, learn how to be involved in the Council here.</p>

				<p>In 2014, The Alumni Council accomplished the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>	Granted $4,000 in emergency funds to organizations responding to disasters, including a fire in Connecticut and the mudslides in western Washington.</li>
					<li>	Raised nearly $8,000 to support the Bike & Build Scholarship. </li>
					<li>	Operated a mentoring program, matching 150 riders to alumni.</li>
					<li>	Coordinated numerous recruitment activities to spread the word about Bike & Build to future riders.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Bike & Build Scholarship</h2>
				<p>The Bike & Build Scholarship program engages young adults from at-risk backgrounds, ages 18-25, in a life-changing opportunity to be engaged in their community. Riders develop skills in teamwork, leadership, and perseverance. This accomplishment furthers empower scholarship recipients to serve others for many years beyond the completion of the trip. </p>

				<p>In 2014, the second year B&B offered this scholarship, Bike & Build fully funded two young adults in our regional ride. Kamal Gatewood and Mindy Zhong, both from Philadelphia, had an incredible experience on Coastal Drift. </p>

			<header class="sticky">Bike & Build Granting Impact</header>
			<section>
				<p>In 2014, Bike & Build granted over $622,000 to 387 affordable housing organizations across the United States. We did that through four programs:</p>

				<ul>
					<li> Competitive Grant Program- Any nonprofit in the U.S. with a project that engages young adults in the affordable housing cause can apply. Application information can be found at bikeandbuild.org/grants. The best part: our riders decide which projects are funded.
					</li>
					<li> Rider $500 Grant- Each rider has the opportunity to designate $500 to the affordable housing organization of their choice.
					</li>
					<li> On The Road Donation- As a thank you to the hosts who so generously host us, we empower them to declare an “On the Road” beneficiary, an affordable housing organization of their choice that receives $100.
					</li>
					<li> Pre-Arranged Contributions- Bike & Build provides grants to a few organizations in exchange for key programmatic necessities, such as our Blitz Build with Pikes Peak Habitat for Humanity in Colorado Springs.
					</li>
				</ul>
			
				Infographics on grant data? Maybe Alex can design something… I’ve got plenty of data.


				<h2>Grantee Profiles</h2>
			
				<article>
					<h2>Habitat for Humanity of North Idaho – Hayden, ID – Providence to Seattle – $8,120</h2>
				
					<p>Habitat for Humanity of North Idaho is using B&B grant funds to engage students from the Kootenai Technical Education (KTEC) High School in the construction of a home for a low-income family. In their original grant application funded by our riders, HfH of North Idaho estimated ten students would participate. However, the program has become so popular that 21 students are enrolled in the Fall 2014 semester. KTEC students receive hands-on training in residential construction to supplement classroom activities. </p>
			
					<p>Katrina Boyer, HfH of North Idaho’s Volunteer Coordinator, stated that the Bike & Build grant has been one of the primary reasons this partnership formed. “The grant enabled us to get started on projects that we otherwise couldn’t have done. It’s very difficult to be unable to start projects for people who really need help. Establishing this relationship with KTEC allows us to reach more of our community members in need.” The grant may help lead to further expansion for the partnership from other sources as well. “Some of the members of KTEC’s Board of Directors have been able to see this progress, and that has opened doors for Habitat to these new networks,” Boyer stated. </p>
			
					<p>Bike & Build has also built with Habitat for Humanity of North Idaho since 2009, and we look forward to continuing that relationship!</p>

					<h2>YouthBuild Philadelphia – Philadelphia, PA – Providence to California – $8,000</h2>
					<p>YouthBuild's innovative alternative education program helps out-of-school youth rebuild their lives while they rebuild their communities. Students receive hands-on construction training as they rehabilitate a dilapidated property for a first time, low-income homeowner. Additionally, YB students take classes towards their high school diploma and prepare for college.  This combination of academic skill building, job training, and support services help former dropouts change the trajectory of their lives and transition to post-secondary education or meaningful employment.  </p>
	
					<p>Bike & Build’s grant is supporting YB Philly’s Building Trades Training Program. Three teams of students are working throughout the semester on three properties in Philadelphia. One property is combining the need for affordable housing with the goal of making it green, as the students are helping build the home to LEED Platinum certification standards. “The students really take ownership of these houses. They have a lot of pride in what they are building,” said Sarah Peterson, YB Philly’s Communications and Development Associate.</p>
	
					<p>Zahfir Slaughter, one of the students working on this project, commented on how much he’s not only learning on the construction site, but also about himself. “I’m really learning how to push myself and build my character. This program is very exciting. We’re not only giving opportunities to a new homeowner, but it also opens up bright futures for students like me.” Zahfir is taking these lessons to heart; after college, he wants to start a career in real estate. “It’ll be fun to one day go past the house we’re building and say ‘I did this.’”</p>

					<h2>Stafford County Economic Development – St. John, KS – North Carolina to San Diego – $7,000</h2>
					<p>Stafford EcoDevo is using affordable housing as a key tool in a broader goal: retaining and recruiting more young adults to live and raise their families in rural Kansas. “Population decline is a big issue in rural economic development, and housing is one the major things to address,” said Carolyn Dunn, Executive Director at Stafford EcoDevo. For example, one problem the community faces is finding housing for teachers hired by the local school district. The average age of a house in Stafford County is 84 years old, and 80% of the housing stock is in subpar condition. Bike & Build funds are being used to help build three new rental units for young professionals, like teachers, throughout the county. </p>
	
					<p>Bike & Build riders didn’t volunteer with Stafford EcoDevo in 2014, but Carolyn had a chance to speak to the NC2SD riders in Dodge City, KS. “I came home after talking with them and, sensing their purpose and passion, I was pretty pumped up. I didn’t sleep much that night!” Stafford EcoDevo has taken the mission of engaging young adults in their community development to heart: they recently hired a college grad from Wichita (“That’s a big deal,” Carolyn said.), and this project inspired a local contractor to hire one of the students in the local high school’s building trades program that had been contributing to the project.</p> 
	
					<p>“It’s all about broad community development,” Carolyn commented. “Economic prosperity, housing, healthy living… it all goes hand-in-hand.” </p>

					<h2>GRID Alternatives Colorado – Denver, CO – Central U.S. – $5,000</h2>
					<p>GRID Alternatives Colorado provides low-to-no cost solar electric systems to families that qualify as low income, while also giving volunteers and job trainees hands-on experience that they can use to get jobs in the growing solar industry. GRID has been operating in Colorado since 2012, when they installed 12 systems. Next year they aim to install 60-70. With the support of Bike & Build funding, they aim to develop the first U.S.-based solar grid that is 100% dedicated to low-income subscribers.</p> 
	
					<p>A key piece of GRID’s outreach engages young adults in long-term contributions to sustainable, affordable housing. They work with multiple community colleges and technical schools to provide hands-on, rooftop experience installing panels. To go along with their classroom education, GRID trainees complete ten volunteer days and ten crew-leading. Once complete, individuals are eligible for to sit for the industry’s certification exam. GRID Colorado also runs its own Solar Corps program, similar to AmeriCorps (unaffiliated), where young adults who participate are employed by GRID but also earn a scholarship to continue their education. </p>
	
					<p>Kristina Sickles, Development Director at GRID Colorado, talked about GRID’s triple-bottom line impact: “We’re helping low-income homeowners with a hand-up, we’re helping young adults, veterans, women, and others gain valuable job experience, and we’re lowering utility costs and overall fossil fuel dependence. Ultimately, we want to bring new people into the convseration about renewable energy, especially those low-income individuals who are most impacted.”
						</p>
					<p>The program’s impact is also felt by their homeowners. “We have a very tight income and it has been a blessing to shave down our bills each month,” said Amy Sue Pinto, a recent GRID client. “We’d looked into solar and knew it was always something we wanted, but it was just not financially feasible until GRID Alternatives helped us out. Everyone on their team was amazing to work with!”</p>

					<h2>Purdue University Habitat for Humanity – West Lafayette, IN – Providence to Seattle – $1,400</h2>
					<p>The Habitat campus chapter at Purdue will be using Bike & Build funds this year to build their capacity for future fundraisers. Our P2S team awarded $1,400 to purchase new bicycles that the organization is using for bike-related fundraisers that will far exceed the grant total provided by B&B. Specifically, Purdue students will participate in the Bucket 100, a two-day ride that travels from Purdue to Indiana University in Bloomington, 120 miles away, and Cover Indiana, a week-long event that traverses Indiana. Students without their own wheels will be able to participate with the Bike & Build-funded bikes, enabling the campus chapter to raise at least $450 per bike/per year. </p>
	
					<p>“These bikes will last us for awhile,” said Michell Obergfell, the chapter’s Vice President of Development. “We work closely with Lafayette Habitat for Humanity, and each year we aim to raise enough money to sponsor a house. This will help us do that.”</p>

			<section>
				<p>Bike & Build allows young adults to invest in communities across the United States through service-based cycling trips.</p> 

				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/7mmSN7J38Xg?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>	
				
				<p>Each summer our cyclists pedal across the United States, raising money for the affordable housing cause and building homes for low-income families. This experience also fosters a commitment to civic engagement far beyond their Bike & Build summer.</p>

				<h3>Why We Ride</h3>
			
				<p>Why is Bike & Build such an impactful experience on our riders? It starts with the <a href="http://www.bikeandbuild.org/cms/content/view/9242/492/"target=_blank>severity of this country’s affordable housing crisis</a>. The takeaway: nearly 50 million Americans do not have the means to own an affordable, durable home. That’s more than the populations of Texas and Florida, combined. </p>

				<h3>How Can You Help?</h3>
				 
				<p>Become a sustaining partner with Bike & Build. We will work with you to customize a partnership package that accomplishes your organization’s needs, while empowering both of our organizations to have an impact on affordable housing in your community. </p>

				<p>Our message reaches all corners of the United States.</p> 
				<ul>
					<li> We average 11,000 individual donors each year. 
					</li>
					<li> Our 330 riders pedal through 47 states. 
					</li>
					<li> We have a burgeoning social media following on Facebook, Twitter (@bikebuild), and Instagram (@bikeandbuild). 
					</li>
					<li> And with over 2,600 alumni since our founding in 2003, our base of young adults only continues to grow. 
				(I bolded and increased font size of those numbers… it looks terrible here, you probably get what I’m going for though.)
					</li>
				</ul>
