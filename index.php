				<h6>From the Board and Staff</h6>
				<h1>Horizons</h1>

				<p>When Bike & Build riders dip their back tires in the Atlantic Ocean, they face a line that divides earth and sky.  The horizon is a picturesque visualization of possibility, as riders stand on the cusp of an unforgettable summer. What lies ahead, in the open road, is an adventure that will test their limits. Ultimately, when our riders crest the horizon that holds the Pacific in view, one summer and 4,000 miles later, they’ve broadened their own vantage points, many ready to serve their communities long after Bike & Build. </p>

				<p>Our trips challenge riders to find the relationship between visible and theoretical horizons.  The subject matter crosses nearly every realm - physical, integral, impact, and identity. “Can I ride 117 miles in a day?”, “Who knew I could learn so much from a Grandmother in Nebraska?”, “How and to whom can we best allocate the money we fundraised?”, “What is my influence now and what could it be?”, “What is next?”.</p>
 
				<p>The answers to those questions compose Bike & Build’s enduring impact.</p>   
 
				<p>The Bike & Build Board of Directors and staff are tremendously proud of the nearly 330 young adults who participated in Bike & Build in 2014. We aim to continue broadening their impact, as we are inspired by these young adults who are committed to a lifetime of service, the housing organizations and low-income families that we support, and the host communities that advocate with us. Each person and family touched by Bike & Build sees views their own horizon differently, but we share one a common goal: more affordable homes for our fellow citizens, and more opportunities for young adults to continue serving to make it so.</p> 
 
				<p>There are a wealth of vantage points in the thousands of miles between Atlantic and Pacific. We are excited to share with you just a few in our 2014 Annual Report.</p>

				<h2>Coastal Drift</h2>
				<p>This year, Bike & Build unveiled Coastal Drift, a new regional route from Maine’s Acadia National Park to New York City. Over the course of 3 weeks and 830 miles, riders weaved in and out of island towns and major metropolises, traversing both urban and rural landscapes and experiencing the mutable affordable housing issue that parallels the varied terrain. Riders experienced the best of Bike & Build in a compact time frame: scenic roads, multiple build days, and the ability to observe and create change in the world around them. The trip was shorter, but the soul was the same- spurred by young adults with adventurous spirits and involved citizens with tremendous hearts.</p>

					<h2>Bike & Build Scholarship</h2>
					<p>The Bike & Build Scholarship program engages young adults from at-risk backgrounds, ages 18-25, in a life-changing opportunity to be engaged in their community. Riders develop skills in teamwork, leadership, and perseverance. This accomplishment furthers empower scholarship recipients to serve others for many years beyond the completion of the trip. </p>

					<p>In 2014, the second year B&B offered this scholarship, Bike & Build fully funded two young adults in our regional ride. Kamal Gatewood and Mindy Zhong, both from Philadelphia, had an incredible experience on Coastal Drift. </p>

					<h1>Grant Programs</h1>
					<p>In 2014, Bike & Build granted over $622,000 to 387 affordable housing organizations across the United States. We did that through four programs:</p>
					
				<ol id="GrantPrograms">	
					<li> <strong>Competitive Grant Program </strong><br> Any nonprofit in the U.S. with a project that engages young adults in the affordable housing cause can apply. Application information can be found at bikeandbuild.org/grants. The best part: our riders decide which projects are funded.
					</li>
					<li> <strong>Rider $500 Grant </strong><br> Each rider has the opportunity to designate $500 to the affordable housing organization of their choice.
					</li>
					<li> <strong>On The Road Donation </strong><br> As a thank you to the hosts who so generously host us, we empower them to declare an “On the Road” beneficiary, an affordable housing organization of their choice that receives $100.
					</li>
					<li> <strong>Pre-Arranged Contributions </strong><br> Bike & Build provides grants to a few organizations in exchange for key programmatic necessities, such as our Blitz Build with Pikes Peak Habitat for Humanity in Colorado Springs.
					</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h3>Interested in applying for a Bike & Build Grant?</h3>
				<p>We fund projects that engage young adults in addressing a demonstrated need in affordable housing. 2015 applications will be available in April and due Friday, June 5. We accept requests from 501(c)(3) organizations between $500 and $10,000. Visit bikeandbuild.org/grants for application materials.</p>

							<h2> Habitat for Humanity of North Idaho</h2>
							<h3> Hayden, ID | Providence to Seattle<h3> 
							<h6> $8,120</h6>
				
							<p>Habitat for Humanity of North Idaho is using B&B grant funds to engage students from the Kootenai Technical Education (KTEC) High School in the construction of a home for a low-income family. In their original grant application funded by our riders, HfH of North Idaho estimated ten students would participate. However, the program has become so popular that 21 students are enrolled in the Fall 2014 semester. KTEC students receive hands-on training in residential construction to supplement classroom activities. </p>
			
							<p>Katrina Boyer, HfH of North Idaho’s Volunteer Coordinator, stated that the Bike & Build grant has been one of the primary reasons this partnership formed. “The grant enabled us to get started on projects that we otherwise couldn’t have done. It’s very difficult to be unable to start projects for people who really need help. Establishing this relationship with KTEC allows us to reach more of our community members in need.” The grant may help lead to further expansion for the partnership from other sources as well. “Some of the members of KTEC’s Board of Directors have been able to see this progress, and that has opened doors for Habitat to these new networks,” Boyer stated. </p>
			
							<p>Bike & Build has also built with Habitat for Humanity of North Idaho since 2009, and we look forward to continuing that relationship!</p>

							<h2>YouthBuild Philadelphia</h2>
							<h3> Philadelphia, PA | Providence to California</h3> 
							<h6>$8,000</h6> 
					
							<p>YouthBuild's innovative alternative education program helps out-of-school youth rebuild their lives while they rebuild their communities. Students receive hands-on construction training as they rehabilitate a dilapidated property for a first time, low-income homeowner. Additionally, YB students take classes towards their high school diploma and prepare for college.  This combination of academic skill building, job training, and support services help former dropouts change the trajectory of their lives and transition to post-secondary education or meaningful employment.  </p>
	
							<p>Bike & Build’s grant is supporting YB Philly’s Building Trades Training Program. Three teams of students are working throughout the semester on three properties in Philadelphia. One property is combining the need for affordable housing with the goal of making it green, as the students are helping build the home to LEED Platinum certification standards. “The students really take ownership of these houses. They have a lot of pride in what they are building,” said Sarah Peterson, YB Philly’s Communications and Development Associate.</p>
	
							<p>Zahfir Slaughter, one of the students working on this project, commented on how much he’s not only learning on the construction site, but also about himself. “I’m really learning how to push myself and build my character. This program is very exciting. We’re not only giving opportunities to a new homeowner, but it also opens up bright futures for students like me.” Zahfir is taking these lessons to heart; after college, he wants to start a career in real estate. “It’ll be fun to one day go past the house we’re building and say ‘I did this.’”</p>

							<h2>Stafford County Economic Development</h2>
							<h3>St. John, KS | North Carolina to San Diego</h3>
							<h6>$7,000</h6>
							<p>Stafford EcoDevo is using affordable housing as a key tool in a broader goal: retaining and recruiting more young adults to live and raise their families in rural Kansas. “Population decline is a big issue in rural economic development, and housing is one the major things to address,” said Carolyn Dunn, Executive Director at Stafford EcoDevo. For example, one problem the community faces is finding housing for teachers hired by the local school district. The average age of a house in Stafford County is 84 years old, and 80% of the housing stock is in subpar condition. Bike & Build funds are being used to help build three new rental units for young professionals, like teachers, throughout the county. </p>
	
							<p>Bike & Build riders didn’t volunteer with Stafford EcoDevo in 2014, but Carolyn had a chance to speak to the NC2SD riders in Dodge City, KS. “I came home after talking with them and, sensing their purpose and passion, I was pretty pumped up. I didn’t sleep much that night!” Stafford EcoDevo has taken the mission of engaging young adults in their community development to heart: they recently hired a college grad from Wichita (“That’s a big deal,” Carolyn said.), and this project inspired a local contractor to hire one of the students in the local high school’s building trades program that had been contributing to the project.</p> 
	
							<p>“It’s all about broad community development,” Carolyn commented. “Economic prosperity, housing, healthy living… it all goes hand-in-hand.” </p>

							<h2>GRID Alternatives Colorado</h2>
							<h3>Denver, CO | Central U.S.</h3>
							<h6>$5,000</h6>
							<p>GRID Alternatives Colorado provides low-to-no cost solar electric systems to families that qualify as low income, while also giving volunteers and job trainees hands-on experience that they can use to get jobs in the growing solar industry. GRID has been operating in Colorado since 2012, when they installed 12 systems. Next year they aim to install 60-70. With the support of Bike & Build funding, they aim to develop the first U.S.-based solar grid that is 100% dedicated to low-income subscribers.</p> 
	
							<p>A key piece of GRID’s outreach engages young adults in long-term contributions to sustainable, affordable housing. They work with multiple community colleges and technical schools to provide hands-on, rooftop experience installing panels. To go along with their classroom education, GRID trainees complete ten volunteer days and ten crew-leading. Once complete, individuals are eligible for to sit for the industry’s certification exam. GRID Colorado also runs its own Solar Corps program, similar to AmeriCorps (unaffiliated), where young adults who participate are employed by GRID but also earn a scholarship to continue their education. </p>
	
							<p>Kristina Sickles, Development Director at GRID Colorado, talked about GRID’s triple-bottom line impact: “We’re helping low-income homeowners with a hand-up, we’re helping young adults, veterans, women, and others gain valuable job experience, and we’re lowering utility costs and overall fossil fuel dependence. Ultimately, we want to bring new people into the convseration about renewable energy, especially those low-income individuals who are most impacted.”
								</p>
							<p>The program’s impact is also felt by their homeowners. “We have a very tight income and it has been a blessing to shave down our bills each month,” said Amy Sue Pinto, a recent GRID client. “We’d looked into solar and knew it was always something we wanted, but it was just not financially feasible until GRID Alternatives helped us out. Everyone on their team was amazing to work with!”</p>

							<h2>Purdue University Habitat for Humanity</h2>
							<h3>West Lafayette, IN | Providence to Seattle</h3>
							<h6>$1,400</h6>
							<p>The Habitat campus chapter at Purdue will be using Bike & Build funds this year to build their capacity for future fundraisers. Our P2S team awarded $1,400 to purchase new bicycles that the organization is using for bike-related fundraisers that will far exceed the grant total provided by B&B. Specifically, Purdue students will participate in the Bucket 100, a two-day ride that travels from Purdue to Indiana University in Bloomington, 120 miles away, and Cover Indiana, a week-long event that traverses Indiana. Students without their own wheels will be able to participate with the Bike & Build-funded bikes, enabling the campus chapter to raise at least $450 per bike/per year. </p>
	
							<p>“These bikes will last us for awhile,” said Michell Obergfell, the chapter’s Vice President of Development. “We work closely with Lafayette Habitat for Humanity, and each year we aim to raise enough money to sponsor a house. This will help us do that.”</p>

				<h2>Claire Collins</h2>
				<h3> Southern U.S. | Trip Leader </h3>
				<h6> <span class="icon-location"></span> <br> Austin, TX </h6>
				<p> When Claire graduated from Stephen F. Austin University in Texas in 2010, she needed an internship to complete her degree. That led her to an AmeriCorps position with Sussex County Habitat for Humanity in southern Delaware, which has become a small pipeline for Bike & Build riders. After a brief dip of the toe into the corporate world, she joined Bike & Build’s 2013 Providence to Seattle route. “I grew so much that summer,” Claire said, “so I wanted to give back to the organization that gave so much to me.” Claire became a B&B Trip Leader this past summer on the Southern U.S. route, helping lead a crew of young adults from Jacksonville, FL to Monterey, CA. </p>
			
				<p> So what’s unique about Claire’s experience with Bike & Build? In between her two B&B trips, her family and she built their own house, a 3-bedroom home just outside of Austin, TX. “I gained so much experience and emotional insight into building homes for other families that I wanted to share that building experience with mine,” Claire said. “It was not my idea of winter fun… it was a lot of hard work, a lot of early mornings on cold winter days. But we built memories as we built the house.”</p>

				<blockquote>“It’s hard to describe the kind of pride you have when you do something like this and share it with family,” Claire reflected. “Bike & Build mirrors that… It’s full of incredibly passionate people.”</blockquote> 

				<p> Claire’s commitment to the affordable housing cause continues on. In January 2015, she begins her next adventure in Berkeley, CA as Program Manager for Rebuilding Together East Bay North. </p>

				<h2>Christopher Benson</h2> 
				<h3>Maine to Santa Barbara</h3>
				<h6> <span class="icon-location"></span> <br> Philadelphia, PA</h6> 
			
				<p> When Chris signed up for Bike & Build prior to the summer, he entered with a unique perspective on the affordable housing cause. His own family had faced hardships growing up, and Bike & Build represented a chance for him to give back. “Although I always had a roof over my head, there were instances where we didn’t have heat or power running into my home. That affected other aspects of my life,” he said. </p>
			
				<p> When he first found out about Bike & Build, it seemed like an ideal match. In high school, he became involved with a Philadelphia nonprofit called the Cadence Cycling Foundation, a program that connects urban youth to cycling. But it was the service component that helped draw Chris to Bike & Build when he graduated. “The main reason I signed up for Bike & Build was to help ensure that others never face the hardships I did. No one in this country should have to go a night without a place to call home and lay their head.” </p>
			
				<p> Chris is continuing his service post-B&B. He is completing an AmeriCorps service year with the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), a national non-profit that helps transform distressed neighborhoods into healthy and sustainable communities. Chris is back in Philadelphia, working to provide housing for low-income families in the Mantua neighborhood.</p>
			
				 <blockquote>“Bike & Build and AmeriCorps are showing me that service to others goes a long because I may just be helping someone live up to their potential to do the same.” </blockquote>

			<h1>Alumni Spotlights</h1>
			
			<section>
				
				<p>In 2014, the Bike & Build Board of Directors and Alumni Council teamed up to present “Alumni Still Serving,” a project that focused on the impact Bike & Build’s riders have in their communities long after their trip.  Check out those features on our website, and read about two alumni in particular who are having a major impact in their communities. </p>
				
				<p>Some former riders spoke about the impact Bike & Build had on them, and how they are staying involved in their community. </p>

					<h2>Danny McGee</h2>
					<h3>Providence to Seattle 2009</h3>
					<h6>
						 <span class="icon-location"></span><br>
						 Grand Rapids, MI
					</h6>
					<p>Five years after his Bike & Build trip, Danny remains one of B&B’s most active alumni in the cause. In his current role as the Director of Sustainability for Well House, he helps provide safe and affordable homes to the homeless. He also works part-time as a consultant to help companies track energy, water, and environmental usage. If that wasn’t enough, he and several other B&Bers (Aileen Strickland, CUS’10 and William Gallmeyer, P2C’11) have started a nonprofit called Homes of Hope, which is building a “Living Building” home for a couple running a community garden in a low-income neighborhood in Grand Rapids. </p>

					<p>Danny was a 2012 recipient of the Chris Webber Memorial Fellowship, a program that engages Bike & Build alumni in self-directed affordable housing projects. He earned funds to support the development of sustainable housing on the Crow Reservation in Montana. The fellowship eventually led to a full-time position, and he continued his work on three other Native American reservations.
					</p>
					<p>Bike & Build helped give Danny the support network to find these opportunities. “I don't know if I can or want to imagine my path without Bike & Build,” he said. “Without it, I wouldn’t have met my fiancé [Aileen], have friends in every city I visit, or have that continued passion and interest in affordable housing.”</p>

					<p>Danny’s extensive background befits his ambitious long-term goals: ending homelessness and the construction of homes that aren’t energy efficient. After that’s done, he might take a break for a little hiking and biking.</p>

					<h2>Karla Sordia</h2>
					<h3>Maine to Santa Barbara 2012</h3>
					<h6>
						<span class="icon-location"></span><br>
						 Boston, MA
					</h6>
					<p>Before Karla signed up for Bike & Build several years ago, she envisioned a life of entirely different pursuits than what she’s doing now. “All my life I had only ever wanted to be either in the medical profession, or do scholarly research. Bike & Build made me realize that I don't have to be a doctor to make a difference and save someone's life.”</p>

					<p>She now works with Heading Home in Boston, an organization dedicated to ending homelessness in the city. As the Data & Research Manager, Karla is responsible for analyzing program outcomes and measurement. She also consults on HUD grant applications for Heading Home’s multiple housing programs across the city. “It's a little like the grant selection process on Bike & Build. You have a bunch of programs, a limited budget, and you use the facts to send on applications that will have the biggest impact.”</p>

					<p>The position sets her up well for long-term involvement in affordable housing. “I love this field. I love the people who are involved in this cause. I've never seen a more passionate, selfless, and devoted group of people, and I hope to get many years working side by side with them.” </p>

				<p>Bike & Build allows young adults to invest in communities across the United States through service-based cycling trips.</p> 	
				
				<p>Each summer our cyclists pedal across the United States, raising money for the affordable housing cause and building homes for low-income families. This experience also fosters a commitment to civic engagement far beyond their Bike & Build summer.</p>

				<h2>Why We Ride</h2>
			
				<p>Why is Bike & Build such an impactful experience on our riders? It starts with the <a href="http://www.bikeandbuild.org/cms/content/view/9242/492/"target=_blank>severity of this country’s affordable housing crisis</a>. The takeaway: nearly 50 million Americans do not have the means to own an affordable, durable home. That’s more than the populations of Texas and Florida, combined. </p>

				<h2>How Can You Help?</h2>
				 
				<p>Become a sustaining partner with Bike & Build. We will work with you to customize a partnership package that accomplishes your organization’s needs, while empowering both of our organizations to have an impact on affordable housing in your community. </p>

				<p>Our message reaches all corners of the United States.</p>
